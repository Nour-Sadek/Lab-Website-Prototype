      <p>Hyun Ok “Kate” Lee was born and raised in S. Korea. She became fascinated with cell biology as an undergraduate researcher in Sean Morrison's laboratory at the University of Michigan, where she studied how stem cells contribute to the repair of damaged tissues in mice. During her graduate research with Bob Duronio at the University of North Carolina, she studied how cell growth, DNA replication and damage are regulated during development, identifying new targets of Cullin4 E3 ubiquitin ligases. She then moved to Dresden, Germany to start her postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics. As a fellow in Tony Hyman's laboratory, she studied how groups of molecules assemble functional organelles that lack membranes. Her study demonstrated that these dynamic, liquid-like assemblies can harden over time, driving the formation of rigid protein clumps that drive cell death and are commonly found in neurodegenerative diseases. She started her lab in the Biochemistry Department at the University of Toronto in 2018.
      <br> <br>
      Dr. Lee has received several awards for her research, as well as for her teaching and research mentorship.</p>
