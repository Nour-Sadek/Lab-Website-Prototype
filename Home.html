        <h2> Research Objective </h2>
        <p> The Lee lab studies how non-membranous organelles are regulated in cells and how their dysregulation  impacts cellular health and function. We use a combination of quantitative live imaging and biochemical  approaches in human stem cells and neurons to gain insight into these questions. </p>

      <div class="Home-Research-Description">
        <p>Cellular space is compartmentalised into numerous organelles that each serve essential functions: from processing specific enzymatic reactions, producing physical force, to storing molecules under stress or during transport. Many organelles like the ER and Golgi separate their processes from the surrounding cytosol using lipid membranes, but a large class of organelles lack membranes, including nucleoli and RNA processing bodies. Membraneless organelles use transient inter- and intra-molecular interactions to concentrate molecules into dynamic and easily deformable compartments, like oil droplets in water. Defects in membraneless organelles have been linked to cellular anomalies causing cell death, yet it is largely unknown how membraneless organelle formation, composition, and function are regulated in cells.</p>
        <p>Our lab uses quantitative live imaging techniques in human stem cells as well as differentiated cells like neurons to study 2 types of membrane-less organelles, RNA granules and DNA damage repair sites.</p>

      <div class="to-figure-out">
        <h4> We want to figure out </h4>
        <ul>
          <li> how their assembly, composition, and dynamics are regulated in healthy cells and altered in degenerative diseases </li>
          <li> how their dysregulation impacts organelle function and cell health </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p> Our ultimate goal is to identify strategies to improve diseases associated with membrane-less organelles, like neurodegeneration. </p>
