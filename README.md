# Lab-Website-Prototype

This is a simple, responsive, static webiste that I created some time around May of 2022, before I joined [Hyun Kate Lee](https://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/hyun-kate-lee)'s research lab for the summer. Back then, I didn't know a single programming language, nor have I written any kind of code before. However, my sister back then was learning how to make a website and so I learned with her, and I was making this website along the way. I believe it took about 1 week for me to make this alongside my learning, and I tried to make it as similar to how lab websites look as possible.

All the credit for my learning goes to this Youtube video from the Youtube channel [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp): [Learn HTML5 and CSS3 From Scratch - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc&t=1s). I have also looked at additional resources for flexbox and making a drop-down nav bar.

This webiste has a lot of flaws: for one, it is not interactive (some lab websites had a tab where the user can send a message directly to the professor's email, while mine doesn't). Also, it is not accessible (so many divs!!), and there is a LOT of repetition. But I am still proud of the end product.

# How to View the Website

Download the project as a zip folder, extract the files, and just double click on the Home.html file, which will open the webiste on your default browser. Use the nav bar to navigate between tabs (Home, Research, People, Publications, Opportunities, and Contact).
