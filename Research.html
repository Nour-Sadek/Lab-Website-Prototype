        <p> RNA and RNA binding proteins form several distinct organelles in neurons, such as RNA processing bodies, stress granules, and RNA transport granules. A common cellular anomaly observed in neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of non-dynamic protein masses called aggregates or plaques. Many of the proteins that aggregate in disease are RNA binding proteins that concentrate in RNA granules. We recently discovered that mutations in RNA granule components cause the dynamic organelles to harden and transform into solid aggregates in vitro. Yet, this liquid-to-solid transition is not readily observed in cells, indicating that there are regulatory mechanisms that prevent protein aggregation inside RNA granules. </p>

        <p> One of the most commonly observed cellular defects in aged cells and in degenerating neurons is the accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. We and others have shown that RNA binding proteins also localize to damaged DNA and form liquid-like membraneless organelles. Disease-associated mutations in these proteins lead to inefficient DNA repair and accumulation of unresolved DNA damage. </p>

        <p> Our goal is to elucidate the development and progression of neuromuscular degeneration, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. To do this, we will first use 2D neuron-muscle co-cultures to examine how neuromuscular connection is altered in patient-derived cells. In parallel, we will engineer a 3D tissue-like system to validate these findings and test repair and regeneration strategies. </p>
